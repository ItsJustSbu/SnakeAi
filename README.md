# SnakeAi

This repository contains a snake ai game that is for my computer science 2: Analysis of Algorithms class 

This repository contains a snakeai.jar file that should be imported into the project file as well as the A-star algorithm that I have used

With this implementation I have managed to sit at position 43/225 students who have submitted their snakes on the game.
